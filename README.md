# [App Name]
This project aims to bridge the gap for students who have trouble finding teammates.

## Motivation
This project is being developed for the RMIT ITS Hackathon.
It is not uncommon for students to find themselves in groups which they had little control over. This often leads to unbalanced work loads, neglected aspects of the work, and provides minimal opportunity for students to grow form eath others' experience.
The app will allow students to present their strengths/weaknesses and evaluate good teammates based on their profiles.
